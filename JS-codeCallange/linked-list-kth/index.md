<ol>
<li>It checks if the head node is null. If it is, it means the linked list is empty, so the function returns null.</li>
<li>It checks if n is less than or equal to 0. If it is, it throws an error with the message "Invalid value: n = " followed by the value of n</li>
<li>It iterates through the linked list starting from the head node and counts the number of nodes in the list, storing the count in the length variable.</li>
<li>It checks if n is greater than the length of the linked list. If it is, it throws an error with the message n + " is greater than the number of nodes in the list".</li>
<li>It calculates the number of steps needed to reach the (length - n + 1)th node from the beginning of the list.</li>
<li>It iterates through the linked list again, starting from the head node, and moves steps number of times to reach the desired node.</li>
<li>It returns the now node, which represents the nth node from the end of the list.</li>

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> null, n=3  <br/>
First, the function iterates through the linked list to find its length. The length is determined to be 5.<br/>
the function proceeds to calculate the number of steps needed to reach the desired node. In this case, steps is calculated as 5 - 3 = 2.<br/>
Starting from the head node, it moves two steps to reach the desired node.<br/>
1 -> 2 -> {3} -> 4 -> 5 -> null <br/>
return 3 <br/>

```
To find the node value that is k places from the tail of a linked list, we start with two pointers: slow and fast, both initially pointing to the head of the linked list. The fast pointer moves k nodes ahead of the slow pointer. If the fast pointer reaches the end of the linked list before completing k iterations, an exception is thrown since k is larger than the size of the linked list. Then, we move both pointers simultaneously until the fast pointer reaches the end of the linked list. At this point, the slow pointer is pointing to the desired node. We return the value of the node pointed to by slow. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the linked list, and a space complexity of O(1).
